Configs
=======

Location ~/cfg
Symlink to these so they stay updated globally

Contains configs (that I have spent many hours fiddling with) that make my
computing experience less frustrating. Leading to me being more sane, and my
friends not disowning me as I go nuts ~~that Alt-g,g doesn't pull up running
applications and let me switch to any of them, as I'm running XMonad.~~ :)

ZSH
===
If you're looking for my zsh config, I have moved it to [dotzsh](https://github.com/ZirroStig/dotzsh).

VIM
===
Likewise my vim config can be found here - [dotvim](https://github.com/ZirroStig/dotvim).
